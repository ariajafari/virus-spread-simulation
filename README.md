**CAUTION**: This code should be intended as a hobby and is not modeling anything in the real world.
The problem that this code tries to simulate is that there are 5000 families and each family has 5 members.
At the beginning one person is infected. In each day everyone meets his/her friend and goes back to his/her home. The infected person can infect his/her friend and family. After how many days all of 25000 persons are infected?
